## Executive Summary

# Executive Summary

**Project Overview**

{customer_name} is undertaking a comprehensive AWS migration to modernize its IT infrastructure and achieve greater scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency. The migration will be completed within {timeline_months} months to the {target_region} region.

**Current State Highlights**

- Total VMs: {scope.get('vm_count', 'Not specified')}
- Windows VMs: {scope.get('windows_vms', 'Not specified')}
- Linux VMs: {scope.get('linux_vms', 'Not specified')}
- Total Storage: {scope.get('storage_tb', 0):.2f} TB
- Total Databases: {scope.get('database_count', 0)}

**Recommended Approach**

A phased migration approach over {timeline_months} months is recommended, leveraging AWS's cloud-native capabilities and executing the migration in structured waves.

**Key Financial Metrics**

- Total Monthly AWS Cost: ${financial.get('monthly_cost', 0):,.2f}
- Total Annual AWS Cost (ARR): ${financial.get('annual_cost', 0):,.2f}
- 3-Year Total Cost: ${financial.get('three_year_cost', financial.get('annual_cost', 0) * 3):,.2f}

*Note: Costs are based on ATX (AWS Transform for VMware) analysis using AWS pricing for the {target_region} region.*

**Expected Benefits**

- Scalability and agility to respond to changing business demands
- Increased reliability and availability through AWS's global infrastructure
- Reduced operational overhead with managed services
- Accelerated innovation and faster time-to-market

**Critical Success Factors**

- Comprehensive application portfolio assessment and wave planning
- Robust cloud governance and security posture implementation
- Organizational readiness through cloud skills development
- Effective cost optimization and continuous monitoring

**Timeline Overview**

A {timeline_months}-month phased approach is planned to meet the migration timeline requirement.

## Current State Analysis

# Current State Analysis

## IT Infrastructure Overview

Based on the ATX assessment, {customer_name}'s current infrastructure consists of:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total VMs | {scope.get('vm_count', 'Not specified')} |
| Windows VMs | {scope.get('windows_vms', 'Not specified')} |
| Linux VMs | {scope.get('linux_vms', 'Not specified')} |
| Total Storage | {scope.get('storage_tb', 0):.2f} TB |
| Total Databases | {scope.get('database_count', 0)} |

## Assessment Scope Details

{scope.get('content', 'Assessment scope details not available in ATX PowerPoint.')}

## Key Observations

The infrastructure assessment reveals a {'database-inclusive' if scope.get('database_count', 0) > 0 else 'compute-focused'} environment that will benefit from AWS's scalable and managed services.

## Migration Strategy

# Migration Strategy

## Recommended Approach

A phased migration approach over {timeline_months} months is recommended, allowing {customer_name} to:
- Build cloud expertise gradually
- Migrate applications based on complexity and business criticality
- Achieve operational excellence while meeting the timeline

## Migration Phases

The migration will be executed in three phases:

**Phase 1: Foundation & Learning (Months 1-{timeline_months//3})**
- Establish AWS foundation and governance
- Build cloud skills and capabilities through training
- Migrate low-risk applications for learning
- Implement DevOps practices

**Phase 2: Scale & Optimize (Months {timeline_months//3 + 1}-{2*timeline_months//3})**
- Migrate majority of applications
- Implement advanced AWS services
- Optimize costs and performance
- Establish operational excellence practices

**Phase 3: Transform & Innovate (Months {2*timeline_months//3 + 1}-{timeline_months})**
- Complete migration of mission-critical workloads
- Implement advanced AWS capabilities
- Achieve full cloud benefits and innovation

## Migration Strategies

The migration will leverage the AWS 7Rs framework:
- **Rehost (Lift & Shift)**: For applications requiring minimal changes
- **Replatform**: For applications benefiting from managed services
- **Refactor**: For applications requiring modernization
- **Repurchase**: For applications better suited as SaaS
- **Retain**: For applications not ready for migration
- **Retire**: For applications no longer needed

## Cost Analysis

# Cost Analysis

## AWS Cost Summary

Based on the ATX (AWS Transform for VMware) analysis:

**Monthly AWS Cost:** ${financial.get('monthly_cost', 0):,.2f}  
**Annual AWS Cost (ARR):** ${financial.get('annual_cost', 0):,.2f}  
**3-Year Total Cost:** ${financial.get('three_year_cost', financial.get('annual_cost', 0) * 3):,.2f}

## Cost Breakdown

- **Total VMs:** {scope.get('vm_count', 'Not specified')}
- **Windows VMs:** {scope.get('windows_vms', 'Not specified')}
- **Linux VMs:** {scope.get('linux_vms', 'Not specified')}
{'- **Databases:** ' + str(scope.get('database_count', 0)) if scope.get('database_count', 0) > 0 else ''}

**Average Cost per VM:** ${financial.get('monthly_cost', 0) / scope.get('vm_count', 1):,.2f}/month

## Financial Overview from ATX

{financial.get('content', 'Financial overview details not available in ATX PowerPoint.')}

## Migration Cost Ramp

The AWS costs will ramp up as the migration progresses:

| Phase | Timeline | AWS Costs |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Phase 1 | Months 1-{timeline_months//3} | ${financial.get('monthly_cost', 0) * 0.3:,.2f}/month (30%) |
| Phase 2 | Months {timeline_months//3 + 1}-{2*timeline_months//3} | ${financial.get('monthly_cost', 0) * 0.7:,.2f}/month (70%) |
| Phase 3 | Months {2*timeline_months//3 + 1}-{timeline_months} | ${financial.get('monthly_cost', 0):,.2f}/month (100%) |

## Cost Optimization Opportunities

- Right-sizing recommendations based on actual utilization
- Reserved Instances and Savings Plans for predictable workloads
- Storage optimization with lifecycle policies
- Spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads
- AWS Cost Explorer and Budgets for continuous monitoring

## Migration Roadmap

# Migration Roadmap

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Foundation & Learning | Months 1-{timeline_months//3} | Establish AWS foundation, build cloud skills, migrate low-risk applications |
| Scale & Optimize | Months {timeline_months//3 + 1}-{2*timeline_months//3} | Migrate majority of applications, implement advanced services, optimize costs |
| Transform & Innovate | Months {2*timeline_months//3 + 1}-{timeline_months} | Complete migration, implement advanced capabilities, achieve full cloud benefits |
